# PPT Master Skill

> AI-driven multi-format SVG content generation system. Converts source documents into high-quality SVG pages through multi-role collaboration and exports to PPTX.

**Core Pipeline**: `Source Document → Create Project → Template Option → Strategist → [Image_Generator] → Executor → Post-processing → Export`

> [!CAUTION]
> ## 🚨 Global Execution Discipline (MANDATORY)
>
> **This workflow is a strict serial pipeline. The following rules have the highest priority — violating any one of them constitutes execution failure:**
>
> 1. **SERIAL EXECUTION** — Steps MUST be executed in order; the output of each step is the input for the next. Non-BLOCKING adjacent steps may proceed continuously once prerequisites are met, without waiting for the user to say "continue"
> 2. **BLOCKING = HARD STOP** — Steps marked ⛔ BLOCKING require a full stop; the AI MUST wait for an explicit user response before proceeding and MUST NOT make any decisions on behalf of the user
> 3. **NO CROSS-PHASE BUNDLING** — Cross-phase bundling is FORBIDDEN. (Note: once the user confirms the Eight Confirmations, the AI may automatically and continuously generate the design spec, outline, SVGs, speaker notes, and proceed into post-processing — as long as prerequisites are met, seamless progression is allowed without waiting for user confirmation)
> 4. **GATE BEFORE ENTRY** — Each Step has prerequisites (🚧 GATE) listed at the top; these MUST be verified before starting that Step
> 5. **NO SPECULATIVE EXECUTION** — "Pre-preparing" content for subsequent Steps is FORBIDDEN (e.g., writing SVG code during the Strategist phase)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## 🌐 Language & Communication Rule
>
> - **Response language**: Always match the language of the user's input and provided source materials. For example, if the user asks in Chinese, respond in Chinese; if the source material is in English, respond in English.
> - **Explicit override**: If the user explicitly requests a specific language (e.g., "请用英文回答" or "Reply in Chinese"), use that language instead.
> - **Template format**: The `design_spec.md` file MUST always follow its original English template structure (section headings, field names), regardless of the conversation language. Content values within the template may be in the user's language.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Source Content Processing

🚧 **GATE**: User has provided source material (PDF / URL / Markdown file / text description / conversation content — any form is acceptable).

When the user provides non-Markdown content, convert immediately:

| User Provides | Command |
|---------------|---------|
| PDF file | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pdf_to_md.py <file>` |
| Web link | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/web_to_md.py <URL>` |
| WeChat / high-security site | `node ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/web_to_md.cjs <URL>` |
| Markdown | Read directly |

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm source content is ready, proceed to Step 2.**

---

### Step 2: Project Initialization

🚧 **GATE**: Step 1 complete; source content is ready (Markdown file, user-provided text, or requirements described in conversation are all valid).

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py init <project_name> --format <format>
```

Format options: `ppt169` (default), `ppt43`, `xhs`, `story`, etc. For the full format list, see `references/canvas-formats.md`.

Import source content (choose based on the situation):

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Has source files (PDF/MD/etc.) | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py import-sources <project_path> <source_files...> --move` |
| User provided text directly in conversation | No import needed — content is already in conversation context; subsequent steps can reference it directly |

> ⚠️ **MUST use `--move`**: All source files (original PDF / MD / images) MUST be **moved** (not copied) into `sources/` for archiving.
> - Markdown files generated in Step 1, original PDFs, original MDs — **all** must be moved into the project via `import-sources --move`
> - Intermediate artifacts (e.g., `_files/` directories) are handled automatically by `import-sources`
> - After execution, source files no longer exist at their original location

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm project structure created successfully, `sources/` contains all source files, converted materials are ready. Proceed to Step 3.**

---

### Step 3: Template Selection

🚧 **GATE**: Step 2 complete; project directory structure is ready.

⛔ **BLOCKING**: If the user has not yet clearly expressed whether to use a template, you MUST present options and **wait for an explicit user response** before proceeding. If the user has previously stated "no template" or specified a particular template, skip this prompt and proceed directly.

Query `${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/layouts_index.json` to list available templates and their style descriptions.
**When presenting options, you MUST provide a professional recommendation based on the current PPT topic and content** (recommend a specific template or free design, with reasoning), then ask the user:

> 💡 **AI Recommendation**: Based on your content topic (brief summary), I recommend **[specific template / free design]** because...
>
> Which approach would you prefer?
> **A) Use an existing template** (please specify template name or style preference)
> **B) No template** — free design

After the user confirms option A, copy template files to the project directory:
```bash
cp ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/<template_name>/*.svg <project_path>/templates/
cp ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/<template_name>/design_spec.md <project_path>/templates/
cp ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/<template_name>/*.png <project_path>/images/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/<template_name>/*.jpg <project_path>/images/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

After the user confirms option B, proceed directly to Step 4.

> To create a new template, Read `references/template-designer.md`

**✅ Checkpoint — User has responded with template selection, template files copied (if option A). Proceed to Step 4.**

---

### Step 4: Strategist Phase (MANDATORY — cannot be skipped)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 3 complete; user has confirmed template selection.

First, read the role definitions:
```
Read references/strategist.md
Read references/shared-standards.md
```

**Must complete the Eight Confirmations** (refer to `templates/design_spec_reference.md` for the template structure):

⛔ **BLOCKING**: The Eight Confirmations MUST be presented to the user as a bundled set of recommendations, and you MUST **wait for the user to confirm or modify** before outputting the Design Specification & Content Outline. This is one of only two core confirmation points in the workflow (the other is template selection). Once confirmed, all subsequent script execution and slide generation should proceed fully automatically.

1. Canvas format
2. Page count range
3. Target audience
4. Style objective
5. Color scheme
6. Icon usage approach
7. Image usage approach
8. Typography plan

If the user has provided images:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images
```

**Output**: `<project_path>/design_spec.md`

**✅ Checkpoint — Phase deliverables complete, auto-proceed to next step**:
```markdown
## ✅ Strategist Phase Complete
- [x] Eight Confirmations completed (user confirmed)
- [x] Design Specification & Content Outline generated
- [ ] **Next**: Auto-proceed to [Image_Generator / Executor] phase
```

---

### Step 5: Image_Generator Phase (Conditional)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 complete; Design Specification & Content Outline generated and user confirmed.

> **Trigger condition**: Image approach includes "AI generation". If not triggered, skip directly to Step 6 (Step 6 GATE must still be satisfied).

Read `references/image-generator.md`

1. Extract all images with status "pending generation" from the design spec
2. Generate prompt document → `<project_path>/images/image_prompts.md`
3. Generate images (CLI tool recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/nano_banana_gen.py "prompt" --aspect_ratio 16:9 --image_size 1K -o <project_path>/images
   ```

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm all images are ready, proceed to Step 6**:
```markdown
## ✅ Image_Generator Phase Complete
- [x] Prompt document created
- [x] All images saved to images/
```

---

### Step 6: Executor Phase

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 (and Step 5 if triggered) complete; all prerequisite deliverables are ready.

Read the role definition based on the selected style:
```
Read references/executor-base.md          # REQUIRED: common guidelines
Read references/executor-general.md       # General flexible style
Read references/executor-consultant.md    # Consulting style
Read references/executor-consultant-top.md # Top consulting style (MBB level)
```

> Only need to read executor-base + one style file.

**Visual Construction Phase**:
- Batch-generate SVG pages → `<project_path>/svg_output/`

**Logic Construction Phase**:
- Generate speaker notes → `<project_path>/notes/total.md`

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm all SVGs and notes are fully generated. Proceed directly to Step 7 post-processing**:
```markdown
## ✅ Executor Phase Complete
- [x] All SVGs generated to svg_output/
- [x] Speaker notes generated at notes/total.md
```

---

### Step 7: Post-processing & Export

🚧 **GATE**: Step 6 complete; all SVGs generated to `svg_output/`; speaker notes `notes/total.md` generated.

> ⚠️ The following three sub-steps MUST be **executed individually one at a time**. Each command must complete and be confirmed successful before running the next.
> ❌ **NEVER** put all three commands in a single code block or single shell invocation.

**Step 7.1** — Split speaker notes:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>
```

**Step 7.2** — SVG post-processing (icon embedding / image crop & embed / text flattening / rounded rect to path):
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>
```

**Step 7.3** — Export PPTX (embeds speaker notes by default):
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> -s final
```

> ❌ **NEVER** use `cp` as a substitute for `finalize_svg.py` — it performs multiple critical processing steps
> ❌ **NEVER** export directly from `svg_output/` — MUST use `-s final` to export from `svg_final/`
> ❌ **NEVER** add extra flags like `--only`

---

### Step 8: Optimizer Phase (Optional)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 7 complete.

> **Trigger condition**: User requests optimization, or design quality needs improvement

Read `references/optimizer-crap.md`

After optimization, you MUST **re-run all post-processing sub-steps starting from Step 7.1** (7.1 → 7.2 → 7.3) — skipping is NOT allowed.

---

## Role Switching Protocol

Before switching roles, you **MUST first read** the corresponding reference file — skipping is FORBIDDEN. Output marker:

```markdown
## [Role Switch: <Role Name>]
📖 Reading role definition: references/<filename>.md
📋 Current task: <brief description>
```

---

## Reference Resources

| Resource | Path |
|----------|------|
| Shared technical constraints | `references/shared-standards.md` |
| Canvas format specification | `references/canvas-formats.md` |
| Design guidelines | `references/design-guidelines.md` |
| Image layout specification | `references/image-layout-spec.md` |
| SVG image embedding | `references/svg-image-embedding.md` |

---

## Notes

- Do NOT add extra flags like `--only` to the post-processing commands — run them as-is
- If Optimizer optimization was performed, re-run post-processing and export
- Local preview: `python3 -m http.server -d <project_path>/svg_final 8000`
